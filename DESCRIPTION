Description: Computes the power and sample size (PASS) required to test for the
    difference in the mean function between two groups under a repeatedly measured longitudinal 
    or sparse functional design. See <https://salilkoner.github.io/assets/PASS_manuscript.pdf> 
    for details of the PASS formula and computational details. The details of the testing
    procedure for univariate and multivariate response are presented in
    Wang (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1214/21-EJS1802> and Koner and Luo (2023) 
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05612>, respectively.
