Description: Computes the power and sample size (PASS) required to test for the
    difference in the mean function between two groups under a repeatedly measured longitudinal or or sparse functional design. See
    Wang (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1214/21-EJS1802> and Koner and Luo (2023) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05612> for details of the testing procedure.
